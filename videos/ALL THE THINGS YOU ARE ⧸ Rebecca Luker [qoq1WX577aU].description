IN LOVING MEMORY OF THE RADIANT REBECCA LUKER (third singer to appear):
Certainly one of the most beautiful songs ever written, here is "ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE" Jerome Kern (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (lyrics) recorded in its original form as it was first heard in the theatre in "Very Warm for May" in 1939.  The London Sinfonietta is conducted by John McGlinn, with the Ambrosian Chorus and soloists (in order of appearance) Judy Kaye, Cris Groenendaal, Rebecca Luker, and Davis Gaines.
