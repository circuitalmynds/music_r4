‘Buena Vista Social Club Presents’ CD, LP & digital - https://worldcircuit.lnk.to/IbrahimFerrerBVSCID 

Two years after the release of the Grammy Award winning album Buena Vista Social Club, many of the same musicians went back into the studio to record the debut album of Ibrahim Ferrer, one of the stars of the BVSC. With Ry Cooder and Nick Gold producing, this release helped elevate Ibrahim to superstar status.     

This album is a collection of eleven songs by the golden voice of Cuban music. Using the Buena Vista Social Club rhythm section and featuring the piano of Rubén González, this album takes the listener on a very different journey to that of any other Cuban record. It is an album of great subtlety and beauty, featuring an extraordinary stylistic range from the nostalgic 1950s American big band style, to stunning ballads with an unusual and opulent guitar accompaniment, as well as rich country-style son.  

Ibrahim Ferrer, who had never been famous in his own right in Cuba, emerged as the one true discovery of the Buena Vista sessions. Always known as a musician’s musician with a naturally gentle and unassuming manner.
